- Looking at both of the Wills and their Bootstrap Page:
- simplistic page, only using css where needed
- numbers each feature being shown off
- Looking at Chris and Stella's Foundation Page:
- I like the way they show off more features in the page itself without numbering them, feels more like an actual website

I prefer Tailwind because it's so much more customizable. With Foundation and Bootstrap, you can see the similarities to existing pages right away.
